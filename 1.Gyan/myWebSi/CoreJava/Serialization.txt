SERIALIZATION
==================

The Serializable interface is a marker interface with no methods or fields. It works like a flag for the JVM. The Java serialization process provided by ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes are fully controlled by the JVM.

writeReplace and readResolve Methods
Serializable classes that need to designate an alternative object to be used when writing an object to the stream should provide this special method with the exact signature:

ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException
And Serializable classes that need to designate a replacement when an instance of it is read from the stream should provide this special method with the exact signature:

ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException
