Views
=======

A View is a virtual relation that acts as an actual relation.
Query expression of the view is stored in the databases system.
Tuples of the view are not stored in the database system and tuples of the view are generated DYNAMICALY every time the view is accessed

Views can be used everywhere were we can use the actual relation.
Views can be used to create custom virtual relations according to the needs of a specific user. 
We can create as many views as we want in a databases system.

Advantages
-----------
Views can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table.
Views take very little space to store; the database contains only the definition of a view, not a copy of all the data that it presents.

Materialized Views:
====================
When the results of a view expression are stored in a database system, they are called materialized views.
