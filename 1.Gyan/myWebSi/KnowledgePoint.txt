Can we declare a method abstract/final/private/static

When you set a method as final it means: "You don't want any class override it." But the constructor (according to the Java Language Specification) can't be overridden, so it is clean.

When you set a method as abstract it means: "The method doesn't have a body and it should be implemented in a child class." But the constructor is called implicitly when the new keyword is used so it can't lack a body.



==============================

When you set a method as static it means: "The method belongs to the class, not a particular object." But the constructor is implicitly called to initialize an object, so there is no purpose in having a static constructor.

 In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web.

 The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations. 
 
 The REST architectural style constrains an architecture to a client/server architecture 
 
 It is designed to use a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP. 
 
 In the REST architecture style, clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol.
