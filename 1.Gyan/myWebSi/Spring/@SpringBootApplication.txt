@ComponentScan

@Configuration 

we generally recommend that your primary source is a @Configuration class.


@ComponentScan

It is recommended to locate main application class in a root package. It allows the @ComponentScan annotation to be used without needing to specify a basePackage attribute. All of application components (@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller etc.) will be automatically registered as Spring Beans.



@EnableAutoConfiguration

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.3.8.RELEASE/reference/html/using-boot-auto-configuration.html
It attempts to automatically configure Spring application based on the jar dependencies that we have added.
