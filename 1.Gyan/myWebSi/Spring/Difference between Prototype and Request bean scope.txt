Difference between request and prototype bean scope in spring?

Prototype creates a brand new instance everytime you call getBean on the ApplicationContext. Whereas for Request, only one instance is created for an HttpRequest. So in a single HttpRequest, I can call getBean twice on Application and there will only ever be one bean instantiated, whereas that same bean scoped to Prototype in that same single HttpRequest would get 2 different instances.

HttpRequest scope

Mark mark1 = context.getBean("mark"); 
Mark mark2 = context.getBean("mark"); 
mark1 == mark2; //This will return true 
Prototype scope

Mark mark1 = context.getBean("mark"); 
Mark mark2 = context.getBean("mark"); 
mark1 == mark2; //This will return false
