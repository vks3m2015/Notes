@Bean is a method-level annotation and a direct analog of the XML <bean/> element. The annotation supports most of the attributes offered by <bean/>,

To declare a bean, simply annotate a method with the @Bean annotation. When JavaConfig encounters such a method, it will execute that method and register the return value as a bean within a BeanFactory. 

You use this method to register a bean definition within an ApplicationContext of the type specified as the method's return value

By default, the bean name will be the same as the method name (see bean naming for details on how to customize this behavior). The following is a simple example of a @Bean method declaration:

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public TransferService transferService() {
        return new TransferServiceImpl();
    }
}
                
For comparison sake, the configuration above is exactly equivalent to the following Spring XML:

<beans>
    <bean name="transferService" class="com.acme.TransferServiceImpl"/>
</beans>
