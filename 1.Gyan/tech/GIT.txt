git checkout
-------------

Switching between existing local branches like 
      git checkout <existing_local_branch_name>
	  
Create a new branch from current branch using flag -b. Suppose if you are at master branch then 
      git checkout -b <new_feature_branch_name> 
will create a new branch with the contents of master and switch to newly created branch

restore file from x rev
     git checkout rev file_to_restore

git checkout is to checkout your desired status of your repository (like branches or particular files).

E.g., you are currently on master branch and you want to switch into develop branch.

git checkout develop_branch
E.g., you want to checkout to a particular status of a particular file

git checkout commit_point_A -- <filename>
