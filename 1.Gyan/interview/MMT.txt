MMT
==============
String
=======
Reverse words of a string without using extra space. Ex. "MMT is great company" should become "company great is MMT". Also implement using recursion
1. Given a character stream of very large length and a number 'k'. You have to print 'k' number of most repeated characters in ascending order.
e.g. Input: " aabcaabbdc ", k = 3
       Output: a b c 


Array
=========
Write a program to find duplicate elements in an array In O(n) time using O(1) extra step
Find Minimum element in a rotated array.  
Find an element in a rotated array without finding rotation point first.  
An array is given. With k swaps, find the maximum number that can be formed using those array elements.
Reverse a stack in place.
You have a sorted array of numbers, e.g. 1,1,1,1,1...,4,4,4,4,4,4....,8,8,8,8,8,8.... You have to return list of unique digits if total number unique digits is maximum 1000 and total number is minimum 1 Billion.

1. Write a java program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using 2 threads. Thread 1 should print odd and thread 2 should print Even numbers.
3. A Company is having a number is cyber cafe. Many customer visit cyber cafe and number if computers are limited. If customer don't find available computer then he leave. You have given a function with 2 arguments : 1 number of computers, 1 : a string with pairs. 1st occurrence of alphabet indicate start of customer and second occurrence indicate end. Only 1 person can use a computer at a time. Return count of customers who left cafe without using computer so that company can improve process.
example :
process(1, ABAB) : should return 1 as only 1 computer is there that is occupied by A when B comes.
process(2,ABACBCDD) : should return 0 as all customer A,B,C, D are able to use Cafe.
process(3, ABCDCDEFEFA) : should return 2 as D and F could use computer.


1. Implement a cache of Generic Type which can contain key and value(Both of Generic type). Write methods to get, add and delete elements from cache. If an element is not accessed for more than 10 mins, remove it from the cache.
