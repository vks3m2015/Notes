Write a program to output power(m,n)
3) Given an infinitely long sorted array having -1’s at the end search a value in that array
4) Provide the complexities for the above questions.
1) 
2) 
 Given a array with n songs,we have to play all the songs only once.Given only 2 functions
1)playsong(songid)
2)getRandom(n) – return the random values in between 1 to n
Told hashmap approach he told if the getRandom() give the same values million of time then its sucks.So I modified my approach and he was impressed.

2) A kind of design question. Given amazon log files of two days.He asked me to find the users who logged in both the days. Had discussion using Hashmap,he want to optimise further I gave solution using trie with little modification in its structure

struct Trie {
    int count[2],
    bool isleaf;
    Trie *child[26];
    Trie() {
          count[0]=count[1]=0;
          isleaf = false;
          for(int i=0;i < 26;i++)
          child[i]=NULL;
    }
};
He appreciated me and left.
