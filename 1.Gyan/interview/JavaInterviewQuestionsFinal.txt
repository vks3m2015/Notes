Following questions were asked
-How to stop a thread from java program itself without using kill -9 command.
- a Person class, create it's some objects, Person class has 4 fields :
Name, salary , address and organization
Now , create a hashset...
Create 3 or 4 objects of Person class in hashset.. and store them in hashset in sorted manner on basis of name . If name is same in two objects , then sort them on basis of salary.
